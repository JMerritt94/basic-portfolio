<h2>About Me</h2>

<img class="pic" src="assets/images/80s guy.jpg" alt="picture of me">
<p>My name is Jay Merritt and I am a graduate of UNC Chapel Hill.
     I have a double major in Philosophy and Political Science.
      I am looking to get into coding so I can have more hard 
      employable skills, but also because I would love to know
       how to make my own website for my writing. </p>

<br>
<p>I have the most gorgeous cat in the world and love him
     dearly. I am a massive sports fan and love the Tar Heels 
     and the Panthers, all while masochistically following the
      Hornets. </p>
